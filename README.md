## Usage

The installation of these utilities may vary depending on their nature. But most likely you can  use them by just copying the file you want to your `~` root folder.

```bash
# Clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/AxiaCore/axiacore_utils.git

# Move lets say `.aliases` to your root directory
$ cd axiacore_utils && mv .aliases ~

# Reload the shell
$ source ~/.bashrc

# Use the shortcuts.
# Open dropbox folder
$ d
```
